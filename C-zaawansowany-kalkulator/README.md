# C-Zaawansowany-Kalkulator

This project is an advanced calculator program written in C, developed as part of my first-semester university studies in Poland in late 2023. It was designed to demonstrate skills in C programming and computational logic as required by the course. The code comments and project documentation are written entirely in Polish.

## Usage

Detailed usage instructions are provided in the project documentation. In general, the calculator reads a `.txt` file containing calculations with blank spaces, computes the results, and outputs a new file with the calculated values filled in the spaces. Example can be found in the provided `in.txt` and `out.txt` files.
